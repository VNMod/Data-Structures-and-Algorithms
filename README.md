# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository contains:

- the Abstract Data Type (ADT) implementations for various data structures: [Double Linked List](https://github.com/VNMod/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Double%20Linked%20List%20ADT), [Stacks](https://github.com/VNMod/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Stack%20ADT), [Double Ended Queues](https://github.com/VNMod/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Double%20Ended%20Queue%20ADT) and [Treaps (Heap Trees)](https://github.com/VNMod/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Treap%20ADT).
- They were written as per the requirements for Virginia Tech's (ECE2564) Data Structures &amp; Algorithms class projects.
- a list of projects that implement popular algorithms and the above mentioned ADTs.
